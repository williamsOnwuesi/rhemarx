                <p1 style = {{fontSize : "2vw"}}>This is our about us page. Band is a multidisciplinary creative studio based in the Pacific Northwest.
                    Their About Us page stands out by showcasing some of their unique and creative projects.
                    No number of words could hope to tell one of their potential clients nearly as much as these pictures can.
                    In this case, the 25 pictures featured on Band's About Us page are worth much more than the 170 actual words youâ€™ll read on the page.
                    The magical visuals and overall simple look and feel make this About Us page one of our top picks.
